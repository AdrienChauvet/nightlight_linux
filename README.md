This is a python script that I use to turn on night light mode in kali linux Xfce desktop environment.

if you want to use it, you can download the script and run it with python3.

```bash
python3 nightlight.py
```

make sure to find out your monitor name and change it in the script.

```bash
    xrandr
```
